This was when the Dark Power descended on this land; a presence of such malevolence that all the trees here perished, and this once pleasant place was turned into a land of desert and hot, choking ash.\n"

"The Dark Power sought to burn all the creatures of the earth in fire. And it was through fire that it wrought numerous dark treasures, weapons, and unspeakable items of dark worth.

And so after many long, long years, through fire, and metal, and the blood of sacrificial victims, at long last, the Dark Power brought into being its magnum opus... The Stuff.\n"
